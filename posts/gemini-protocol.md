Last night while I was browsing THE WEB I stumbled upon something really interesting. I was finishing my Lubuntu build on an old laptop and checking out /r/unixporn and there was this desktop which seemed normal but it had a browser with a veeery clean UI and a page with brutalist style with no fancy stuff, just as I like it. The url of the page was starting with "gemini://" and it got me wondering. So I began my crusade in the endless oceans of the interwebs to find out what it was --just kidding, it took me 0.00021 seconds to find out exactly what it is with Google, hah!

See, i always hated the way the internet has become, so much information so many laters soOO many interactions, you can read my rant about it [here](/posts/2022-02-19-Hello-World.html). Anyway, upon finding out the Gemini protocol, it filled me with joy, just like the first time I became online.

Currently I'm testing it out with a browser named Kristall [Kristall](https://kristall.random-projects.net/), and browsing gemini://medusae.space -_an index similar to the old Yahoo! where can browse by topic, or search_. to see what catches my attention.

Another thing that I like the most about it though is that it is a very good platform (protocol or whatever) to write blogs on! The stripped down feeling, the text only interface, OH THE JOY.

I will check out the ways of hosting a website using Gemini in the upcoming days and will probably roll out deadstar.one on it as well.

Until then, take care!
