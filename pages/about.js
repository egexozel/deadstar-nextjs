                <p>Hi, I'm Ege! I'm a photographer, musician (mostly electronic and synth stuff), & a curious internet consumer who is interested in making websites. I've made this blog as a means to escape from TheSocialMediaâ„¢ (it's funny, i know) as I felt those platforms are not flexibile enough for people to share and do what they truly want. I'm intending to use this blog as a means to share what I like, find interesting online and other casual stuff. If you found your way to this site, welcome! I can't promise I will be updating this frequently, however you are free to browse. If you have any questions or want to contact me you can send me an email at egexozel@gmail.com. Have a nice day!</p>
